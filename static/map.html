    <h1>Map Temporarily Unavailable</h1>
    <p>So sorry! The map is temporarily disabled while Jeff is on vacation to see the IRL eclipse. Gov groups seeing each other on the map can cause undue paranoia. Your Rust+ connection will NEVER be used against you. Out of an abundance of caution, the map has been disabled pending discussion about its desired future when Jeff returns from vacation in a few days. I am personally sorry to you if you are inconvenienced and I am so happy that you enjoy my little app here.</p>
    <p>You can still pair as many servers as you want at a time. The in-game powered ranks will continue to update.</p>
